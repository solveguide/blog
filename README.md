Every issue can be solved.

Every single issue, in the world, can be solved.

In fact, every issue is already solved.

In actuality there is not a single unsolved issue left in the world.

And there never were any issues in the first place.

Reality simply exists. It is our goals, desires, and discomforts that drive us to change reality, and therein interpret aspects of reality as Issues. Issues are a product of perspective, not reality. Since, as humans, we can’t do away with our perspective, we might as well accept that there are plenty of issues in the world (from a certain point of view) and boy do a lot of them seem to have no solution at all.

## How I Got Here

It is easy to get swept up in that cacophony of the world's issues. For me that looks like treating each issue that enters my awareness as the putative “Most Important Issue”, meaning I have to learn about it, come up with firm (read: baseless) opinions on it, and start petitioning for change! Except that new issues enter my awareness faster than I can learn anything about the last one. This happens over and over, until the internet browser in my head has so many tabs open that I can’t even tie my shoes, let alone treat the people in my life with love and respect.

Eventually I learned how to resist jumping into the “Most Important Issue” and after some time, their edges blur. The cacophony remains, but it turns into white noise. There’s no messages or words or testimony, just an endless constant drone. I would pick out a piece of the noise and hear that “something needed to be done about X in the next year or it’s the end!” but a year later the drone remained. Another piece of the noise would say, “we now know how to end scarcity and crime!” but the drone remained. Then I discovered that the only real issue that exists is my desire for the droning cacophony to end!

If I could accept the endless white noise and let go of my desire, I wouldn’t have a single issue in the world. Didn’t that mean, that I had also solved every issue that could be picked out of that white noise? At least from my perspective. Didn’t that also mean that every person could solve every issue by simply accepting it as well?

The ever-present and instant solution to EVERY issue is to stop desiring that reality be any different from the way it is.

**If:**
Reality + Perspective = Issues
Nirvana = Reality - Issues

**Then:**
Nirvana = Reality - Reality + Perspective

**Therefore:**
Perspective = Nirvana

Assuming the total negation of reality, Buddhism can help you wipe a huge number of issues off the board! For everything else, there’s Solve Guide.

Should you choose to forgo the universal solution of acceptance, Solve Guide will help you find the root causes, alternative solutions and optimal paths towards servicing the desires that you’ve decided to entertain at least a little longer.

## Caveats

Solve Guide will not work for you unless you are willing to make two agreements with yourself:

1. I am honest with myself first.
1. I am open to temporary change.

Even if you decide to make these agreements or have made them long ago, you will find yourself abrogating them often and without even realizing it is happening. That is normal. Don’t Panic. When a particularly perceptive or persnickety part of the universe brings this abrogation to you awareness, you will compelled to attack it! Or deny the accusation! Or reverse the the claim on it, pointing out that the universe is actually the offender and you are the victim!

Remember in these moments to take a breath, to be honest with yourself first, and to remain open to temporarily changing the way you see yourself.

If you are not willing to make these agreements, you can still work with Solve Guide, but you’ll probably come to the conclusion that Solve Guide does not work for you. You will find yourself stalled on problems or in trying to pick between universally bad options. You will feel like you are being taken further from where you want to go and that you are wasting your time entertaining ideas you already know don’t work. You may come to a solution or two, but my guess is that in the long run you’ll find that “this app just isn’t very helpful!”. If that happens to you, know that I’m very sorry to have wasted your time!

If you are willing to make these two agreements, then get ready to be reminded of them often! Solve Guide will often prompt you, in critical moments, to be honest with yourself about whether you can agree to a particular fact, or whether a proposed solution is realistically achievable. Solve Guide will push you to keep coming up with alternatives when you are already pretty sure you know the best path forward. It will ask you to pause and entertain possibilities that you may have dismissed or make you feel anxious.
Know that the mark of a mature mind is the ability to entertain an idea without accepting it, and ONLY YOU can choose to accept a fact, issue or solution. Afterall, the universal solution of Acceptance, is always available to you should you decide an issue just isn’t worth exploring any further.

## Caveats to the Caveats

Being honest with yourself first does not mean that you must be honest to everyone all the time. Privacy is real. Tact is real. Self-interest is real. Surprise birthday parties are real. None of these things can exist if we insist dealing in absolute honesty. You must be honest with yourself to discover what you truly desire and what you are willing to give up to achieve it. That doesn’t mean you are obliged to live life in the Truman Show or play poker with your cards face up. After being honest with yourself first, you’ll always get to choose how much honesty to share with others (including Solve Guide!)

Being open to temporary change does not mean saying yes to everything or tolerating intolerance. It’s true that change is not good or bad, it’s your mind that perceives it so. But since we cannot do away with our perspective. . . not all change is good! More importantly, not all change is temporary. There are words you cannot take back, there are actions you cannot undo and there are wounds that do not heal. Change is safe when reversibility is certain. Being open to temporary change is about preserving a moment between stimuli and reaction for a Reasoned & Reasonable Response. Being open to change means you can articulate why you are saying “no” to an invitation, or recognizing and reject DARVO in yourself or another.

If you are normal then you have REAL issues in your life. In the course of trying to solve them, you may feel anxious, scared or unsafe. These feelings are also normal. Feeling are a part of reality but they are not the whole of reality. No one chooses their feelings and any feelings you have are valid. You will need to be honest with yourself first in deciding whether your feelings are leaving you with enough resources to continue solving an issue or not. Acceptance is always available to you. When your desire to feel better grows more insistent than your desire to solve an issue, follow that urge and take care of yourself. As you take care of yourself, remain open to those feeling changing in the future. You will discover over time that you are capable of more than you may have originally believed.

## Why Me?

My unique gift that I want to share with the world is that I am a reasonably structured thinker and I have a knack for being able to use that structure to bring clarity to others. Often times this happens by asking a few questions, sometimes questions that may seem odd and coming forth with a metaphor that makes people laugh and exclaim “THAT’S Right!”.  (Chris Voss on “That’s Right vs. You’re Right”).

This gift has served me well in the professional world where I encountered the “IDS Issue Solving System” in the Entrepreneurial Operating System originally published in the book Traction, by Gino Wickman. IDS encourages teams to tackle issues in their weekly management meeting by:

- Identifying & Isolating underlying root issues causing pain.
- Discussing ALL the options for dealing with the issue, including acceptance.
- Solving the root issue by agreeing to a SMART action item and holding the assignee accountable at next week’s meeting.

I have set up many a Trello board to help teams manage this process, but there are nuances to actually communicating with humans that left me wanting.

In my personal life I’ve often relied on Non-Violent Communication, which encourages us to notices four specific kinds of communication:

- Feelings
- Observations
- Interpretations
- Needs

An education in physics and other sundry sciences gave me a healthy respect for Observations and Interpretations. Working for and with startups on product market fit, user experience research, customer led growth and jobs to be done honed my ability to notice, confirm and define the detailed & often secret needs of others. And well, I’m still working on the skills to navigate and embrace Feelings.

I found that solving hard problems AND communicating ethically with humans was too hard to do by myself in real-time.

Solve Guide is my attempt to outsource some of the structure of solving issues to an artificially empathetic technology guide, so that I can focus on being honest with myself, and softening my beliefs, habits and character to change. Not to mention communicating with kindness and patience to the people with whom I desire to spend my life, and solve my issues.

Solve Guide is a work in progress. I hope it works. But if it doesn’t I know I’ll have universal acceptance to fall back on.

Every issue can be solved.
