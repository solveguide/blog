# Introduction to Issues

When I think of issues, I think of that [scene from Malcom in the Middle where Lois asks Hal to replace a lightbulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0). 

When you come home, you just want to turn on the lights and get about your business. But one things leads to the next and pretty soon you're changing your transmission fluid, not really sure how you got there.

When I first saw that scene, I remember thinking, "But. . .you've got the lightbulb in your hand! Just go change it, THEN fix the shelf".

Fundamentally this is an attention management problem. All sorts of sophisticated systems have been developed to help people and teams stay focused and reward themselves for FINISHING tasks rather than starting new ones. Here are some great reads on the topic:

# Issues in Solve Guide

Issues in Solve Guide are the largest circle in the venn diagram that contains references to:

Seeds: The original articulation of dissatisfaction. These are useful to hang-on to in order to test your ultimate solutions, however they are often distracting when working through an issue.

Symptoms: The aspects of the issue that manifest themselves. This is how you know you really have an issue at all. They are also how you will be able to tell if you've really made the issue go away.

Facts: The feelings, observations, interpretations and needs relevant to the issue and its context.

Root Issue: The single most fundamental source of the largest share of symptoms that you can influence.

Root Theory: The relationship between Root Issues for complex Issues

Great song writters have to write 100's of songs to just come up with on all-time classic. Hypothesis are all those other songs.

Solutions: Potential paths to make the symptoms created by your choosen Root Issue go away.

Solve: Solve is the verb form of a choosen solution. The solve is the act of making the symptoms go away. Solves are how we test our ability to understand reality and ourselves.
